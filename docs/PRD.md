## Executive Summary

### Product Overview

The Token Vesting Smart Contract is a decentralized application (dApp) that enables organizations to create and manage time-locked token distribution schedules on the blockchain. This product solves the critical need for trustless, transparent, and automated token vesting in the crypto ecosystem.

### Value Proposition

**For Organizations (Employers/DAOs):**
- Automate token distribution without manual intervention
- Build trust with employees/contributors through blockchain transparency
- Reduce operational overhead and human error
- Align long-term incentives with organizational goals

**For Recipients (Employees/Contributors):**
- Transparent visibility into vesting schedules
- Trustless execution (code is law)
- Self-service token claiming
- Verifiable on-chain proof of equity

### Key Differentiators

- FR-2.2: SHALL validate beneficiary is not zero address
- FR-2.3: SHALL validate amount is greater than zero
- FR-2.4: SHALL validate duration is greater than zero
- FR-2.5: SHALL validate cliff is less than or equal to duration
- FR-2.6: SHALL prevent duplicate schedules for same beneficiary
- FR-2.7: SHALL transfer tokens from caller to contract

function createVestingSchedule(
    address beneficiary,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 cliffDuration,
    uint256 duration,
    bool revocable
) external nonReentrant
```

**Event:**
```solidity
event VestingScheduleCreated(
    address indexed beneficiary,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 start,
    uint256 cliff,
    uint256 duration
);
```

**Error Handling:**

- Revert if duration == 0
- Revert if cliffDuration > duration
- Revert if beneficiary already has schedule
- Revert if insufficient token balance
- Revert if token transfer fails

**Priority:** P0
**Effort:** 5 story points

---

#### Feature 3: Vested Amount Calculation

**Description:** View function to calculate current vested amount based on time elapsed.

**Functional Requirements:**
- FR-3.1: SHALL be a view function (no state changes)
- FR-3.2: SHALL return 0 if current time < cliff time
- FR-3.3: SHALL return full amount if current time >= start + duration
- FR-3.4: SHALL calculate linear vested amount otherwise
- FR-3.5: SHALL use formula: `amount * (now - start) / duration`
- FR-3.6: SHALL be callable by anyone
- FR-3.7: SHALL return 0 if no schedule exists

**Technical Specifications:**
```solidity
function vestedAmount(address beneficiary)
    public
    view
    returns (uint256)
```

**Algorithm:**
```
Input: beneficiary address
Output: vested token amount (uint256)

1. Load schedule from storage
2. If schedule.amount == 0, return 0
3. If block.timestamp < schedule.cliff, return 0
4. If block.timestamp >= schedule.start + schedule.duration:
     return schedule.amount
5. Else:
     timeElapsed = block.timestamp - schedule.start
     return (schedule.amount * timeElapsed) / schedule.duration
```

**Edge Cases:**
- No schedule exists → return 0
- During cliff → return 0
- At exact cliff moment → return proportional amount
- After vesting complete → return full amount
- Integer division rounding → favor contract (round down)

**Priority:** P0
**Effort:** 3 story points

---

#### Feature 4: Token Release

**Description:** Function for beneficiary to claim vested tokens.

**Functional Requirements:**
- FR-4.1: SHALL be callable only by beneficiary

**Technical Specifications:**
```solidity
function release() external nonReentrant
```

**Event:**
```solidity
event TokensReleased(
    address indexed beneficiary,
    uint256 amount
);
```

**Transaction Flow:**
1. Load schedule from storage
2. Calculate vested amount via internal function
3. Calculate unreleased = vested - schedule.released
4. Require unreleased > 0
5. Update schedule.released += unreleased
6. Transfer tokens to msg.sender
7. Emit TokensReleased event

**Error Handling:**
- Revert if no schedule exists
- Revert if unreleased amount == 0
- Revert if token transfer fails

**Priority:** P0
**Effort:** 4 story points

---

#### Feature 5: Schedule Revocation

**Functional Requirements:**
- FR-5.1: SHALL be callable only by contract owner
- FR-5.2: SHALL check schedule.revocable is true
- FR-5.3: SHALL check schedule.revoked is false
- FR-5.4: SHALL calculate vested amount at revocation time
- FR-5.5: SHALL transfer vested amount to beneficiary

event VestingRevoked(
    address indexed beneficiary,
    uint256 refunded
);
```

**Transaction Flow:**
1. Load schedule from storage
2. Require schedule.revocable == true

**Priority:** P1
**Effort:** 6 story points

---

### Enhanced Features (Phase 2)

#### Feature 6: Multiple Schedules Per Beneficiary
