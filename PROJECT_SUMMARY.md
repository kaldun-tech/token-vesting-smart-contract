## 🎯 Use Cases Demonstrated

### 1. Employee Equity Vesting
```
Scenario: Startup grants 10,000 tokens to employee
- 1 year cliff (no tokens released)
- 4 year total vesting (linear after cliff)
- Revocable if employee leaves early
```

### 2. Investor Lockup
```
Scenario: ICO investor receives 1M tokens
- 6 month cliff
- 24 month vesting
- Non-revocable (guaranteed schedule)
```

### 3. Team Allocation
```
Scenario: DAO allocates tokens to core team
- No cliff (immediate vesting start)
- 2 year vesting
- Revocable by DAO vote
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Implemented Protections
- ✅ ReentrancyGuard on token transfers
- ✅ Input validation (zero address, zero amount checks)
- ✅ Access control (only beneficiary can release)
- ✅ SafeMath (Solidity 0.8+ overflow protection)
- ✅ Event emission for all state changes

### Known Limitations
- ⚠️ Single schedule per beneficiary
- ⚠️ Revocation power (if enabled)
- ⚠️ Block timestamp manipulation (~15 seconds)
- ⚠️ No pause/emergency stop
- ⚠️ No upgrade mechanism

### Pre-Production Requirements
- 🔴 Professional security audit required
- 🔴 Multi-sig for admin functions
- 🔴 Time-locked operations
- 🔴 Bug bounty program
- 🔴 Mainnet testing strategy

### Interview Talking Points

**"Tell me about this project"**
> "I built a token vesting smart contract that organizations can use for employee equity and investor lockups. It's deployed on Base Sepolia with verified source code. I implemented linear vesting with cliff periods, achieved 100% test coverage, and optimized for gas efficiency. The contracts use OpenZeppelin's security patterns and follow industry best practices."

**"What was challenging?"**
> "The main challenges were implementing time-based logic correctly, ensuring security against reentrancy attacks, and optimizing gas costs. I had to deeply understand Solidity's timestamp behavior and test edge cases thoroughly. I also learned about the trade-offs between feature flexibility and gas optimization."

**"What would you do differently?"**
> "For production, I'd add support for multiple vesting schedules per user, implement a pause mechanism for emergencies, add multi-sig admin controls, and get a professional security audit. I'd also consider using The Graph for event indexing and building a frontend dashboard."
